  // is mutable and remembers these reserved blocks. This let's freshIdScanners be restartable,
  // which should be a requirement as tables WILL be restarted. However, this is a heavy handed
  // solution to a simple problem. Ideally, we would use 2 ID columns. The first would be a
  // fixed Long for ALL rows. This Long would be obtained from an idSource. It would be tied
  // to the freshIdScanner and would never change for the life of the scanner. The 2nd column
  // would simply be the row #. These would be unique, easy to calculate, and not require
  // constantly access an AtomicLong for every row. More over, they would be trivially
  // restartable. This can't happen currently, because there are too many places in our code
  // that assume an ID columns have a specific shape (eg. exactly N columns). However, there
  // is a proposal to fix this. Once we have more flexible ID columns, we should revisit this.
